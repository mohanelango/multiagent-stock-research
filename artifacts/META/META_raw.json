So a lot of the technological methods of age verification will fail in that narrow band and there might be false positives where certain individuals who are over 16, slightly over 16 will be banned from these platforms because their content was classified as relevant to under an 16 sort of target demographic.\"</p><p>\"It's probably going to be service distortion, service failure for a couple of days or weeks maybe until the platforms figure this out, and we'll see a lot of articles on media and maybe on social media itself of false positives.\"</p><p>Meta, Snapchat, TikTok and Google declined to comment.</p><p>The law states that such platforms must take \"reasonable steps\" to block minors.</p><p>If the rollout goes smoothly, it could guide the world in cutting kids' exposure to harms like bullying or weight issues from screens.</p><p>The UK and France added age gates for porn earlier this year.\u00a0</p><p>Then in November, Denmark said it would ban under-15s from social media.</p>"
